            necessary or appropriate to respond to claims and legal process
            (including but not limited to subpoenas), to protect the property
            and rights of HelloJubi or a third party, to protect the safety of
            the public or any person, or to prevent or stop any illegal,
            unethical or legally actionable activity.
