          <p>
            As part of our policy, we are required to maintain a log of the

            your email / social media handles, gender, location and name, and

          <p>
            We will enrich our database to provide you with the best information
            on health, manage referrals, and solicit feedback on your experience
            with Jubi and its partners. With our partners Abt and USAID, we may
            also use some kinds of information for research and analytics

            or appropriate to respond to claims and legal process (including but
            not limited to subpoenas), to protect the property and rights of
            Jubi or a third party, to protect the safety of the public or any
            person, or to prevent or stop any illegal, unethical or legally
            actionable activity.
